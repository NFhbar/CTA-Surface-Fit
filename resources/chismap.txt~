CHI SQUARE MAP

Calculates the fitting parameters for a range of x values and y values.

Offset Start x = the starting value of tx
Offset End x = the ending value of tx
Step x =  the step to take in tx

Offset Start y = the starting value of ty
Offset End y = the ending value of ty
Step y =  the step to take in ty

It calculates Chi Square for each set of the initial guess of the parameters given each offset in tx and ty:

beta
alpha
dtx
dty
tz

It plots a Chi Square map with all the values of Chi Square for each iteration. It plots the minimum value of Chi Square and the calculated one.
