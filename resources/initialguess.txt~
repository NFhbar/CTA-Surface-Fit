INITIAL GUESS

Select the initial guess for the parameters for the fitting algorithm.

beta[radians]  = the angle for the Ry matrix
alpha[radians] = the angle for the Rx matrix
tx = the translation in x axis
ty = the translation in y axis
tz = the translation in z axis
Focal Length =  the focal lenght of the surface 
Iterations = the number of iterations of the algorithm

If the matrix does not have an inverse the algorithm will stop with a warning, if this happens, the initial parameters have to be changed.
