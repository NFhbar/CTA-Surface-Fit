GRID

Selects the parameters to generate the grid.

Start x = starting point in x
End x   = ending point in x
Step x  = step to take in x direction
Start y = starting point in y
End y   = ending point in y
Step y  = step to take in y direction

Total number of points in x is calculated as: 
#x = (End x - Start x)/Step x

Total number of points in y is calculated as: 
#y = (End y - Start y)/Step y

Data is generated as:

for (int i = 0; i <= #x; i++)
            {
                    for (int j = 0; j <= #y; j++)
                    {
                        x[0] = Start x + (i * Step x);										
                        y[1] = Start y + (j * Step y);										 

                        dz = (gsl_ran_gaussian (rng,ds));							

                        z[2] = SURFACE TYPE + dz;				

                        w = w + 1;

                        Data.row(w-1) = (Rx*Ry*(r - translation)).t();
                        ModelData.row(w-1) = r.t();
                    }
            }

SURFACE TYPE: depends on the selected surface. See "Surface Type".

dz = Error selected. See "Error in z-axis".

Data = matrix to keep transformed data.

Rx = rotation matrix in x
Ry = rotation matrix in y
translation = [tx,ty,tz]. translation vector.

ModelData = matrix to keep untransformed data.

w = keeps track of the row to allocate in matrix.
