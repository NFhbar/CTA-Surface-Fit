MAGNITUDE PLOTS

Plots the Magnitude K over M plot, or the Magnitude Plot.

Uses the loaded/calculated residuals to decompose the surface into its radial and angular modes:

ChiSquare = [dz(rj,phij) - SUM_k*SUM*m*(Amk/sqrt(rj))*EXP(i2Pi*k*x + i2Pi*m*y)]^2r*dr*dphi

where:

dz(rj,phij) = residuals (either calculated or loaded) in cylindrical coordinates
SUM_k = sum over k
SUM_m = sum over m
k = radial mode
m = angular mode
x = rj - rmin/rmax + rmin
y = phij/delta
Amk = amplitude constant 
delta = 2Pi/16

The cylindrical coordinates are calculated as:
for(int i = 0; i<=J-1; i++)
        {
            CylindricalData(i,0) = sqrt( dz(i,0)*dz(i,0) + dz(i,1)*dz(i,1) );
            CylindricalData(i,2) = atan2( dz(i,1),dz(i,0) );
        }
where:
dz = residuals
CylindricalData(i,0) = rj
CylindricalData(i,2) = phij

It then finds the magnitude constant by solving (numerically) for:
dChiSquare/dAmk = 0

This returns:

Amk = (rmax + rmin)*(1/J)*SUM_J*(dz(rj,phij)/sqrt(j))*EXP(-i2Pi*k*x - i2Pi*m*y)]

The input parameters are:

Span of M = the number of angular modes to calculate, goes from -M to M
Span of K = the number of radial modes to calculate, goes from -K to K
Plot Modes of M = the number of angular modes to plot for the Magnitude K over M plot
Plot Title = the title for the selected plot

Types of Plots

Magnitude K over M:
This plots Amk*Amk(complex conjugate) over the Span of M. The first plot from the top is m = 0, where the y-axis = m(0) and the x axis runs over Amk*Amk(k). Then the plots go down as m = m+1.

Magnitude Plot:
This plots k over m over Amk*Amk, where the x-axis= m, y-axis=k, and z-axis=Amk*Amk

Usually let M=3, K=150, and Plot Modes of M = 3.
