Error in z-axis.

It includes an error in the z coordinate. 

Uses GSL Randon Number Generator with a Gaussian:
    gsl_rng *rng;
    rng = gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_mt19937);
    gsl_rng_set(rng, time(NULL));
    double dz = (gsl_ran_gaussian (rng,SIGMA));

SIGMA is selected by the user. Zero is equivalent to selecting no error.
